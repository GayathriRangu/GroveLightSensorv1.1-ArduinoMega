# GroveLightSensorv1.1-ArduinoMega

Interface the Grove light intensity sensor v1.1 with Arduino Mega. The sensor is an Analog-to-Digital sensor. It takes in Analog values and outputs digital values (0-6455 approx.) in terms of Lux which is a metric to measure the light intensity of the ambience. The code is in C++ for Arduino. I have also included the images of the circuit that we realized. The communication between microcontroller (ATmega2560) and the sensor is done using I2C (Inter-Integrated Communication) wherein data is transferred serially between master(microcontroller) and the slave(sensor). The communication is synchronous in nature. There are only two pins used for communication - SDA (Serial Data) and SCL(Serial clock). SDA is used for serial data transfer(bit by bit) to and fro the microcontroller and sensor whereas SCL is set by master to slave (one-way) at the beginning of the data transfer. For more details about I2C Communication and other modes of communictaion that electronic devices use to talk to each other, refer to this article https://www.circuitbasics.com/basics-of-the-i2c-communication-protocol/ We have struggled a lot to get the circuit diagram roght but at last we could figure out. Hope this helps you too in figuring out the right connections. In short, VCC-5V , CHG-GND, SDA-SDA, SCL-SCL (sensor-arduino) connections.)
